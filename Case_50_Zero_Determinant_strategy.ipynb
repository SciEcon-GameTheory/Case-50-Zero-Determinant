        "Block interception attack refers to the attack between miners and miners in a open block pool. The key idea is that the attackers only send part of their work proof to the manager of the pool. Attackers can neither use the computational power for attacking for other purposes, nor gain extra profits from those computational power. Therefore, this kind of attack will on one hand, lead to the waste of computational power, on the other hand, hurt the overall profits of the pool.\n",

We assume the profits will expand $r (r>1)$ times, system will be expanded revenue and fair distribution according to work force, in order to simplify the model, assuming that each miner's work force is the same, the expanded Earnings will be split, when men don't loyal to dig, to block the mine pool intercept attack, mineral pool administrator will calculate by its contribution to the force distribution of profits, such behavior not only reduce the mine pool gross income, income of all miners will also reduce, this is the \"Free riders\" in the mining process (Free rider). Here we only consider mine pool has two miners, each miner has two strategies to choose: Cooperation (C) or Attack (A).
